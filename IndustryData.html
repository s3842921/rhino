      <p><br>Utilising a ‘skills priority list’ from the Australian Government, we can determine the desirability 
          of each person’s dream role </p>
       <p>The Desirability of a job is defined by the demand for employers to seek people to work the specific 
           job type. To rank the 799 various broad occupations in this list, the National Skills Commission 
           considered how understaffed each specific role is across the nation (with individual states listed 
           alongside). Afterwards, each role was analysed for the future demand of employees filling the same role, 
           which would consider job security alongside.  </p>

          <p>A job with a high demand from employers would mean that job security and finding employment would be easier, 
              especially if demand is strong. However, since the jobs are severely understaffed, this may increase stress 
              levels, along with work-life balance. This occupation may ‘burn out’ the individual because of this
            </p>

            <p>A job with a low demand from employers would result in bragging rights if you got the job, which would 
                increase self-esteem. However, these jobs would have poor job security if the occupation is in the low 
                to medium future demand bracket. This would also create issues if the individual were to move jobs. If 
                a certain occupation is not in national shortage, employers may not be actively looking for this role
                 type in the first place. This may create high difficulty becoming employed in the persons preferred 
                 field of work. </p>

                    shown that this job is the 17th most desirable occupation from the Australian Government. This means that I should have little trouble 
                    finding employment (such as my ideal job) that suits me. </p>
